# DataReaderToObject
This sample application is created to demonstrate the usage of AutoMapper library i.e. https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMapper/
Created the extension for IDataReader, which will convert the IDataReader instance to any Typed Object Model (DTO Object). Extension does support the generic type. The code for the extension is written in DataReaderExtension.cs file.
MyDataBuilder.cs file is used to create IDataReader instance for testing purpose.
